## Hi, I'm Karen. I'm a Marketing/Growth Data Analyst,and Content Strategist. 
<p>I'm on a thrilling journey where I get to blend my passion for numbers and storytelling into the exciting world of business.
<p></p>My career kicked off as a content strategist, but I couldn't stop pondering: Did my content actually lead to those awesome conversions? What worked like magic, and what fell a bit flat? ðŸ¤”
<p></p>These curious question marks set me on a path towards data analytics, the golden key to unlocking those answers. My mission? To make marketing strategies smarter, reach wider audiences, and save a boatload of resources (both money and energy).
<p></p>This repository is my treasure trove of experiments aimed at making marketing "smarter." Think classic analysis tools like <b>Marketing Attribution</b>, <b>Segmentation Analysis</b>, <b>A/B testing</b>, <b>ROI analysis</b>, and even some innovative tricks like <b>Similarity analysis</b>. 
<p></p>Exciting stuff, right? Keep your eyes peeled for more, as there's always more in the pipeline! ðŸš€

        <h3> 1. Marketing Attribution Analysis</h3>
            <p> Multi-touch Attrition model(MTA) is a classic model to evaluate the contribution of each channel to the final sales. It helps the marketing decision maker make better allocation of their marketing resources (either money or staff). Moreover, the marketing team can calculate the ROI of the effort by comparing the sales generated by channel, and cost deployed on them.
            <p>There are multiple MTA models, including First touch, Last touch, Time-decay, Position-based, U-shaped, Data-driven...etc. Here I run one of the most popular attribution model, that is, <b>Time-Decay Attribition Model</b>.<br>
            <p><b>Time-Decay Attribition Model</b> usually use this following calculation as decay factor:
            <br><b>0.5<sup>(t/half-life)</sup></b><br>
