## Hi, I'm Karen, a Marketing/Growth Data Analyst, also a Content Strategist. 
I feel lucky that I'm being able to combine both of my love of numbers and stories together, and apply in the buisness world. Starting early career as a content strategist, I always can't help wondering for every campiagn I made: Did my content lead to final conversion? What did work, and what didn't? Those question marks led to my following years of pursuing in data analytics--which I believe is the key to final answer. To make marketing efforts smarter, impact wider, while saving tons of resources (both $ and energy).
