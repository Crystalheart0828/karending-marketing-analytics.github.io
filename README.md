## Hi, I'm Karen. I'm a Marketing/Growth Data Analyst,and Content Strategist. 
<p>I'm on a thrilling journey where I get to blend my passion for numbers and storytelling into the exciting world of business.
<p></p>My career kicked off as a content strategist, but I couldn't stop pondering: Did my content actually lead to those awesome conversions? What worked like magic, and what fell a bit flat? ðŸ¤”
<p></p>These curious question marks set me on a path towards data analytics, the golden key to unlocking those answers. My mission? To make marketing strategies smarter, reach wider audiences, and save a boatload of resources (both cash and energy).
<p></p>This repository is my treasure trove of experiments aimed at making marketing "smarter." Think classic analysis tools like <b>Attribution Analysis</b>, <b>Segmentation Analysis</b>, <b>A/B testing</b>, <b>ROI analysis</b>, and even some innovative tricks like <b>Similarity analysis</b>. 
<p></p>Exciting stuff, right? Keep your eyes peeled for more, as there's always more in the pipeline! ðŸš€
